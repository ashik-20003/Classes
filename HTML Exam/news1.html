    <h1>Coconut thief arrested in Varkala.</h1>
    <p>In a dramatic turn of events, authorities in Varkala successfully apprehended a notorious coconut thief following an intense chase through the town's residential areas. The suspect, who had been evading police for months, was caught after a high-speed pursuit that lasted nearly two hours. Officers from the local police department coordinated a strategic blockade, ultimately cornering the thief near the waterfront. The arrest brings relief to residents who had reported numerous missing coconuts from their properties over the past several weeks.</p>
