    <h1>Ram and SSD prices hike.</h1>
    <p>The technology market has witnessed a significant surge in RAM and SSD prices in recent months, affecting consumers and businesses alike. Industry analysts attribute this price increase to supply chain disruptions and increased demand for high-performance computing components.
