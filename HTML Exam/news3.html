    <h1>Rupees inches 7 paisa to reach 90.40 against US Dollar.</h1>
    <p>The Indian rupee inched up by 7 paise today to close at 90.40 against the US dollar, driven by subdued trading and a mix of domestic and global cues. Traders pointed to modest capital inflows and stronger-than-expected economic data as supporting factors, while ongoing concerns about crude oil prices and foreign fund flows limited further gains. Currency analysts expect the rupee to remain range-bound in the near term, with market participants watching inflation indicators and central bank signals for direction.</p>
